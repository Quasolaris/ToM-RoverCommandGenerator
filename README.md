# ToM-RoverCommandGenerator
Program that creates a sequence of commands for a rover in Take on Mars. It uses relative bearings form the rover to the waypoints and calculates the relative bearings point by point.

## Planned Features
- Calculating path with vectors
- calculating relative DEG (RT/LT) for waypoints
- Generating sequence commands for rover
- Auto type in Take on Mars

## Roadmap 0.01 to 1.0
* Relative  DEG
* Calculating path
* Plotting path on graph
* Generating commands
* Auto type in Take on Mars

=================== Release 1 ===================

## Following Features
- Plan path in app on high res. map of sector
- Calculate power consumption
- Caluclate time needed for path
- Calculate length of path

## Roadmap 1.1 to 2.0
* Calculate length of path
* Calculate time for path
* Calculate power consumption
* Path can be planned on high res. map in app

=================== Release 2 ===================
