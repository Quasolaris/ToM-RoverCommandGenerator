# ToM-RoverCommandGenerator
Program that creates a sequence of commands for a rover in Take on Mars. It uses relative bearings form the rover to the waypoints and calculates the relative bearings point by point.

## Planned Features
- Calculating path with vectors
- calculating relative DEG (RT/LT) for waypoints
- Generating sequence commands for rover
- Auto type in Take on Mars

## Roadmap
* Relative  DEG
* Calculating path
* Plotting path on graph
* Generating commands
* Auto type in Take on Mars
