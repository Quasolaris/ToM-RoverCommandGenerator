Collection of my research on relative bearings with vectors


https://www.problemsphysics.com/vectors/bearings_angles_vectors.html

Calculation seem sto be straight forward:

a := Deg. of V1
b := Deg. of V2
c := Relative Bearing in DEG

c = b - a

Is c greater than 180 then it has to make a right turn (RT), where the DEG will be (360 - c)

Will test this as soon the first script stands.
